# Black-Jack-Game
It is a classic casino game "Black Jack". I've used HTML, CSS and Javascript for this project.

## Rules 
Game Rules Blackjack is a popular card game that is simple to play. The object of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:

• Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a "blackjack" or "natural") without a dealer blackjack; 

• Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21 

• Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21 ("busted").
